             *
             * We first convert to YCrCb color space, from RGB color space.
             * Why do we do this? Well, in the RGB color space, chroma and
             * luma are intertwined. In YCrCb, chroma and luma are separated.
             * YCrCb is a 3-channel color space, just like RGB. YCrCb's 3 channels
             * are Y, the luma channel (which essentially just a B&W image), the
             * Cr channel, which records the difference from red, and the Cb channel,
             * which records the difference from blue. Because chroma and luma are
             * not related in YCrCb, vision code written to look for certain values
             * in the Cr/Cb channels will not be severely affected by differing
             * light intensity, since that difference would most likely just be
             * reflected in the Y channel.
             *
             * After we've converted to YCrCb, we extract just the 2nd channel, the
             * Cb channel. We do this because stones are bright yellow and contrast
             * STRONGLY on the Cb channel against everything else, including SkyStones
             * (because SkyStones have a black label).
             *
             * We then take the average pixel value of 3 different regions on that Cb
             * channel, one positioned over each stone. The brightest of the 3 regions
             * is where we assume the SkyStone to be, since the normal stones show up
             * extremely darkly.
             *
             * We also draw rectangles on the screen showing where the sample regions
             * are, as well as drawing a solid rectangle over top the sample region
             * we believe is on top of the SkyStone.
             *
             * In order for this whole process to work correctly, each sample region
             * should be positioned in the center of each of the first 3 stones, and
             * be small enough such that only the stone is sampled, and not any of the
             * surroundings.
